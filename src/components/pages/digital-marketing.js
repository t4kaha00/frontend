    <h1>1. Content marketing will be &ldquo;content selling&rdquo;</h1>
    <p>More and more marketers realize the importance of content marketing.</p>
    <p>According to the <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/2018/11/21/7-content-marketing-stats-2019/" target="_blank">report by Content Marketing Institute</a>, 93% of the most successful B2B content marketers reported that their organization is extremely/very committed to content marketing.</p>
    <p><a href="../src/content-marketing-trends.png" class="fancybox"><img class="shadow-img" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/14-digital-marketing-predictions-for-2022/cache/content-marketing-trends-700x434.png" alt="" width="700" /></a></p>
    <p>Companies are changing their approach to creating marketing collateral. That&rsquo;s where the term <em>content selling</em> comes into the play.</p>
    <p>This essentially means that content should be created to support sales processes. Marketing teams need to have a strategic approach to content creation and align content strategy with the customer journey.&nbsp;What is more, it becomes crucial to measure the impact of content marketing on sales. This can be achieved by setting <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2013/02/kpis-for-content-marketing-measurement/" target="_blank">the right KPI's for content marketing</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ask yourself:</p>
    <p><em>How many leads were generated by content marketing efforts?</em></p>
    <p><em>Does my content nurture existing customers and build loyalty?</em></p>
    <h1><a name="software"></a>2. A single marketing software provider</h1>
    <p>Did you know that <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2017/06/average-enterprise-uses-91-marketing-cloud-services/" target="_blank">the average enterprise uses 91 marketing cloud services</a>?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Marketers are overwhelmed by the number of marketing technology vendors. Thus, one of the emerging trends in digital marketing is switching to an all-in-one software.</p>
    <p>As such, the single sign-on to all Liana Technologies&rsquo; tools was designed to improve marketers&rsquo; work efficiency and save their time.</p>
    <h1><a name="advertising"></a>3. Hyper-targeted advertising</h1>
    <p>If you work in the field of marketing, the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner_blindness" target="_blank">banner blindness</a> is most likely familiar to you.</p>
    <p>What does it imply?</p>
    <p>People tend to ignore ads as most of them are irrelevant and intrusive. However, even though people feel overwhelmed by bad digital ads, they don't really mind the good ones.</p>
    <p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/fionabriggs/2016/04/18/almost-half-of-consumers-will-reject-brands-sending-irrelevant-or-too-many-ads-study-shows/#43045e99769b" target="_blank">research by Digital Connections</a>, 49% of people will disregard a brand if it bombards them with ads or if they perceive the advertising to be irrelevant; while 36% of respondents are more likely to buy from a brand that sends them tailored messages.</p>
    <p>This means, that the future of digital advertising is exposing users only to hyper-relevant ads and using precise targeting audiences.</p>
    <p>In the following video, we reveal 5 ways to find advertising audiences for Google Ads:</p>
    <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NcSwpkQ1CsM" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
    <h1><a name="voice"></a>4. Voice search</h1>
    <p>The future of voice-driven search queries seems promising.</p>
    <p>Look:</p>
    <p>In the US alone, voice commerce sales are expected to reach $40 billion in 2022.</p>
    <p><a href="../src/voice-search-statistics-2018-commerce.jpg" class="fancybox"><img class="shadow-img" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/14-digital-marketing-predictions-for-2022/cache/voice-search-statistics-2018-commerce-500x460.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
    <p>Think about it:</p>
    <p>Have you already started optimizing your content for voice search?</p>
    <h1><a name="jobs"></a>5. New marketing jobs</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/05/23/10-charts-that-will-change-your-perspective-of-big-datas-growth/#2c25c93b2926" target="_blank">The explosive growth of Big Data</a> results in a need to critically analyze and interpret enormous chunks of data that companies receive.</p>
    <p>Therefore, new jobs, such as <strong>Market Research Analysts</strong> will take off in the near future.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/gms/files/2012/02/Top-30-fastest.pdf" target="_blank">Boston University predicts</a> that the position of Market Research Analyst will increase in popularity by 41,2% by 2020.</p>
    <p>In addition, <strong>Growth Hacking</strong> jobs are taking off right now. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/01/how-to-get-a-job-as-a-growth-hacker/" target="_blank">Growth hackers</a> utilize various digital marketing strategies and have a more experimental and lean approach to marketing.</p>
    <h1><a name="personalization"></a>6.&nbsp;Personalization</h1>
    <p>90% of brands will practice at least one form of marketing personalization by 2020. (<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-5-marketing-predictions/" target="_blank">Gartner</a>)</p>
    <p>While <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/personalized-marketing-examples" target="_blank">some forms of personalization</a> have been already utilized by companies for a while, fully personalized websites will boom in the near future.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a> is doing it right: right on the homepage, it&rsquo;s analyzing your previous behavior and promoting products that it thinks you might want.</p>
    <h1><a name="sales"></a>7.&nbsp;Sales and marketing will align</h1>
    <p>The increased popularity of technology, such as marketing automation platforms, gradually blurs the lines between marketing and sales.</p>
    <p>Almost a third of our <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/l/marketing-automation-survey-results-by-liana-technologies-whitepaper.html" target="_blank">survey</a> respondents claim that marketing automation facilitates closer cooperation between sales and marketing.</p>
    <p><a href="../src/challenges_and_benefits_of_marketing_automation_results_main_benefits.jpg" class="fancybox"><img class="shadow-img" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/challenges_and_benefits_of_marketing_automation_results_main_benefits.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
    <p>Thus, in the future, we can witness a closer collaboration between sales and marketing teams and in some companies, both of them will even merge.</p>
    <h1><a name="investment"></a>8. Investment in digital marketing will grow</h1>
    <p>As more and more companies have a significant ROI of digital marketing spend, investment in this area will increase steadily.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/11/30/global-digital-marketing-software-industry-set-reach-7496bn-2022" target="_blank">The Drum</a> predicts that the global digital marketing software (DMS) market is touted to grow from $37.48bn in 2017 to $74.96bn by 2022.</p>
    <p>The market will especially grow due to increased investment in digital advertising. According to <a href="https://www.cmo.com.au/article/641955/digital-advertising-continues-dominate-marketing-budgets/" target="_blank">CMO</a>, 87 percent of total marketing budgets will be going to digital by 2022.</p>
    <h1><a name="customer"></a>9.&nbsp;New customer behavior</h1>
    <p>As we already cited in <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/blog/21-digital-marketing-trends-for-2018-infographic.html" target="_blank">our previous piece about digital marketing trends</a>, Gen-Zers are expected to constitute about 40 percent of all consumers by 2020.</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s only one more year to go.</p>
    <p>How to cater to this consumer category?</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Work with influencers. Gen Zers and social media celebs go hand in hand these days. In fact, <a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/20-influencer-marketing-statistics-that-will-surprise-you" target="_blank">86% of women use social media for purchasing advice</a>.</li>
    <li>Focus on video content. 95% of people have watched an explainer video to learn more about a product or service in 2018, according to <a href="https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics-2018/" target="_blank">Wyzowl&rsquo;s survey</a>.</li>
    <li>Be transparent. Generation Z values transparency and makes their purchasing decision based on that.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>More about transparency in the next part.</p>
    <h1><a name="transparency"></a>10.&nbsp;Transparency</h1>
    <p>94% of consumers say they would remain loyal to a brand that <a href="https://www.coredna.com/blogs/content-marketing-trends" target="_blank">provides complete transparency</a>.</p>
    <p>Needless to say, companies failing to deliver transparency and authenticity will miss out.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/blog/gdpr-and-mailing-lists-hold-on-to-your-subscribers-and-make-more-in-the-process.html" target="_blank">The GDPR regulation</a> that came into force in 2018 showed us the importance of handling customer data in a transparent way.</p>
    <p>This is one of the ways we at Liana Technologies show that we handle customers data in a secure way:</p>
    <p><a href="../src/liana-technologies-marketing-automation-handbook.png" class="fancybox"><img class="shadow-img" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/14-digital-marketing-predictions-for-2022/cache/liana-technologies-marketing-automation-handbook-700x463.png" alt="" width="700" /></a></p>
    <h1><a name="app"></a>11.&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an app for that&rdquo;</h1><p>From checking bus schedule to booking a holiday &mdash; everything is done with a mobile device today. The penetration of mobile has no sign of declining.</p>
    <p>According to AdAge, <a href="https://adage.com/article/digitalnext/mobile-marketing-trends-2017/307343/" target="_blank">mobile spending will grow to $65 billion</a> by 2020 in the US alone.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.business2community.com/mobile-apps/5-key-things-mobile-marketers-need-to-know-about-5g-02132721" target="_blank">The development of 5G technology</a> will facilitate the way marketers use mobile data and convey their message online.</p>
    <h1><a name="social"></a>12.&nbsp;New social media behavior</h1><p>This might sound unbelievable:</p>
    <p>People tend to spend less time on social media these days. What is more, quite many users are deactivating their social media accounts.</p>
    <p>32% of all users in the UK and U.S. say they have deactivated or closed a social media account in the past 12 months, per <a href="https://www.globalwebindex.com/" target="_blank">GlobalWebIndex</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="../src/report-by-globalwebindex.png" class="fancybox"><img class="shadow-img" src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/14-digital-marketing-predictions-for-2022/cache/report-by-globalwebindex-700x513.png" alt="" width="700" /></a></p>
    <p>What does it mean for marketers?</p>
    <p>Firstly, there&rsquo;s clearly a need to create more engaging content, for example, by using <a href="https://www.relevance.com/how-ar-and-vr-can-propel-content-marketing-into-a-new-age/" target="_blank">VR &amp; AR technologies</a>.</p>
    <p>Secondly, other channels, such as <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/email-marketing.html" target="_blank">email marketing</a> and <a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/press-releases-and-media-monitoring.html" target="_blank">PR</a> come to the fore.</p>
    <h1><a name="marketing"></a>13.&nbsp;Just-in-time marketing</h1>
    <p>Just-in-time marketing is focused on creating marketing content that&rsquo;s needed, when it&rsquo;s needed, and attuning it to the needs of consumers exactly when they are ready to buy.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.accenture.com/fi-en/insight-bpo-just-in-time-marketing" target="_blank">Accenture Interactive</a> found out that 38% of the companies as just-in-time marketers have grown their annual revenues by more than 25%.</p>
    <p>How to apply just-in-time marketing in practice?</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.lianatech.com/solutions/marketing-automation.html" target="_blank">A marketing automation platform</a> will deliver your message at the right time and do a lot of leg work for marketers.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.lianacem.com/l/marketing-automation-in-a-nutshell.html?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=digital_marketing_predictions_2022" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.lianatech.com/media/international-pictures/en/news/14-digital-marketing-predictions-for-2022/cache/marketing-automation-whitepaper-500x263.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p
    ><h1><a name="ai"></a>14.&nbsp;The rise of AI</h1>
    <p>We are approaching the stage where AI is no longer a buzzword. AI technologies will soon be incorporated into digital marketing and have a huge impact on it.</p>
    <p>According to Gartner, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2017-07-18-gartner-says-ai-technologies-will-be-in-almost-every-new-software-product-by-2020" target="_blank">AI features will be in almost every new software product by 2020</a>.</p>
